WHAT ARE THE PROGRAMS? 

There are three small programs here that are meant to help you build your a follower base in Twitter faster.
This set of programs would be ideal for new, lets say, campaign or cause Twitter-accounts, that just need to be set up quickly and get them a relevant follower base of actual people.

With these programs, you can crate lists of the people/handles that possible "influencer" follow. Then you can follow all those handles/people, and hopefully, they might follow you back. 
So with relatively litte effort, you can make yourself to be found and acknowledged by twitter-accounts that you want to follow your account.
After you've done that, you can run the unfollow.py program (heh), and unfollow all those accounts that don't follow you back. 

To run all of these programs you'll need to have a twitter-account.
You need to get the Twitter-developer keys and update those to the keys.py to be able to run the rest of the three programs. 

These are all made with Python3 and you run them through Terminal. 

1. PROGRAM: kyes.py

Once you have gotten the Twitter developer-keys, replace the ones "consumer keys" etc. in the keys.py program with your own keys. Save and your done. 

2. PROGRAM: list_handles_to_follow.py

This program will create list (text.document) of the handles/accounts that a given handle himself follows. 

3. PROGRAM: follow3.py

Run this program and read the list (text.document) of the followers you just created. This program will follow all the handles in the list. 


4. PROGRAM: unfollow.py

Give those handles that you just followed few days to react and follow you back. Run the unfollow-program to unfollow all those hadles that didn't follow you back.
This might seem an extra effort, but you might look like a bot-account yourself, if you would be following thousands of accounts but you only had a few hundrer followers youself.
